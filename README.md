### Better battery

A simple app to hibernate once the battery is 70-75% for a safe long storage. A lithium battery loses
its max capacity if stored a fully charged for the long time. The best charge range is around 70-75%.

Notes: 
- app does NOT drain battery irself. (TODO) Use other tools for that purpose.
- does NOT hibernate in case charger is connected. Emits sound and prints a message instead.
- does NOT hibernate if charged less than 70% and no charger is connected. Emits sound and prints
a message instead.
